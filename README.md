On macOS / Linux:
```bash
python3.11 -m venv your_environment_name_without_qoutes  # this creates the virtual envirnment (takes upto 1 min) replace placeholder with your choice of virtual env name 
source <environment_name_without_qoutes>/bin/activate # activates the environment you can see the environment name in terminal
```

On Windows (PowerShell):
```powershell
python3.11 -m venv your_environment_name_without_qoutes  # this creates the virtual envirnment (takes upto 1 min) replace placeholder with your choice of virtual env name
your_environment_name_without_qoutes\Scripts\activate  # activates the environment you can see the environment name in terminal
```
To deactivate:
```bash
deactivate
```
### 5. Install Dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 6. Create and add .env file 
Add all your environment variables/ secret keys in this file for local testing (never push the secret keys to remote branch)

```bash
python document_qna.py
```

Acting together and by instrument in writing, they may remove the Trustee, appoint additional Trustees who meet the clause 13.2 qualifications, and appoint a new Trustee to replace a Trustee who resigns or ceases by operation of law. Before exercising these powers, they must consult with the Noongar Advisory Company and the existing or outgoing Trustee, and before removing a Trustee they must consider whether the Trustee has breached or failed to act satisfactorily under the Deed. They may request the Trustee to conduct an appropriate selection process for a replacement trustee, and if there is no Trustee, they must conduct that selection process in consultation with the Noongar Advisory Company. When a Nominee Entity is proposed, they must assess whether it meets the Dedicated Trustee Requirements and, if they decide not to appoint it, provide written reasons sufficient to enable it to remedy the issues. Upon exercising their powers, they ensure the incoming and outgoing trustees execute a Deed of Appointment substantially in the form in Schedule 8. The Attorney General must act jointly with the Noongar Appointor for appointments and removals under clause 13.4."
